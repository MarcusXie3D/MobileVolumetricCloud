# MobileVolumetricCloud
Volumetric cloud for mobile platforms: completely procedural, and can fly through.
I just tried to make volumetric cloud for mobile games, which doesn’t need to be placed manually and you can pass through the clouds like airplanes.
怎么用：把package导入你的工程。如果没用，把Asset文件夹里的东西拷进你工程的Asset文件夹。然后打开Demo_Scene。
How to Use: import that package into your project. If that doesn't work, copy all things in the Asset folder into the Asset folder of your project. Then open Demo_Scene.
